## ðŸ”„ Next Steps for Real Spotify

When you want real Spotify data:

1. **Create Spotify App** at [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. **Get Real Credentials** (Client ID & Secret)
3. **Replace in SpotifyService.java**:
   ```java
   private static final String CLIENT_ID = "your_real_client_id";
   private static final String CLIENT_SECRET = "your_real_client_secret";
   ```
4. **Uncomment Real API Code** (I can help with this)
