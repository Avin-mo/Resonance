# Resonance
### Your personal music diary

**Resonance** is a desktop application that connects to your Spotify account to create a personal music diary.  
Import your listening history and add personal notes to capture memories, thoughts, and feelings about the songs that soundtrack your life.

**ðŸŽµ Spotify Integration** - Connect your Spotify account to automatically import your recently played tracks and add personal notes to create a comprehensive music diary. 

This app is designed for anyone who enjoys journaling, loves music, treasures memories, or wants to track their life through the lens of the songs they listen to.

I chose this project because music is a big part of my daily life, Iâ€™m almost always listening to something, and certain periods of my life are deeply tied to the music I was into at the time. For example, when I think back to summer 2018, the songs I listened to then immediately bring back the mood and memories of that time. Until now, Iâ€™ve kept these notes in a generic notes app, but I wanted to create something more intentional and personal, a journal made specifically for preserving memories through music.
