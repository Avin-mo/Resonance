# Resonance
### A personal app to log and reflect on your music and mood

**Resonance** is a desktop application that helps users capture and reflect on their daily listening habits.  
Each entry records the song, artist, mood, and date, creating a meaningful journal of how music accompanies their lives. Over time, users can browse and search their entries by date, mood, artist, or song. They can also have a visualization of their mood throughtout a selected month or year in the shape of a color gradient with every color representing a certain mood entry.

This app is designed for anyone who enjoys journaling, loves music, treasures memories, or wants to track their life through the lens of the songs they listen to.

I chose this project because music is a big part of my daily life, I’m almost always listening to something, and certain periods of my life are deeply tied to the music I was into at the time. For example, when I think back to summer 2019, the songs I listened to then immediately bring back the mood and memories of that time. Until now, I’ve kept these notes in a generic notes app, but I wanted to create something more intentional and personal, a journal made specifically for preserving memories through music.
